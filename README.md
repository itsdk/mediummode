mediummode
==========
Inspired by [hard mode](https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode) but less...hard.

Medium mode is a Vim plugin that allows character-wise motion, but only up to a point.

Usage
-----
Medium mode proves `MediumModeEnable`, `MediumModeDisable`, and `MediumModeToggle` commands.

Out of the box, medium mode will be automatically turned on and configured to
listen to the usual Vim motion keys.  See the documentation for configuration
instructions

Installation
------------
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is recommended
